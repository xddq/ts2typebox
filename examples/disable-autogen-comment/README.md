# Example

When ts2typebox is installed (simply issue npm i -g ts2typebox to do so), clone
the repo, cd into this directory and:

- Remove the old generated-types.ts file `rm generated-types.ts`
- Use ts2typebox to generate the typebox types based on the types.ts file
  `ts2typebox --disable-autogen-comment`
- done :]
